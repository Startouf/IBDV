			<h1>Custom data visualisation</h1>
			<h2>Let it rock :D</h2>
			
			<h2>Input</h2>
				<ul><li>2 dimensional data, and 1+n param per data object : [ Description, Number Views, Number of comments, Number vote Up, Number vote Down,  etc.]
				</li><li>Not yet sure about the params that could go in n : see below
				</li></ul>
			
			<h2>Idea behind it :</h2>
				<p>
					I'm going to work on a collaborative wiki this summer, and for example, people are going to post their ideas on some points,
					and it could be cool to have a visualisation of all their ideas, and their "hotteness" i.e. if many people posted comments, replies, etc.
					So, I'd like to get a global view of all the ideas, sort them by hotteness, and draw some kind of scatterplot. 
				</p>
				
			<h2>How to visualise</h2>
				<p>
					Ideas will be sorted by thei "hotteness", and the first one will be displayed in the center of the screen as a big "bubble". 
					Then, the first other ones (by hotteness) will be on a circle around the first idea (for example, a circle that can contain 9 bubbles
					Then, the second batch will be displayed on a bigger circle, that can contain more ideas
					Etc. Till there are no more ideas to place
				</p>
				<p> 
					The bubbles can have different properties to represent the n parameters :
					<br />The size : could represent the global hotteness (like a ||.||2 of all the values)
					<br />The color : could represent the overall approbation of the idea (number Votes Up/number Votes Down)
					<br />What else ?
				</p>
			
			<h2>Current data format</h2>
			
			<p>A 2D Array [[data1],[data2],...] where each data is an array of :
				<ul>
					<li>String : title of idea
					</li><li>Number of comments
					</li><li>Number of Votes Up
					</li><li>Number of Votes Down
					</li>
				</ul>
