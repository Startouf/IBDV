			<h1>Hottness data visualisation</h1>
			<!--
			<h2>Idea behind it :</h2>
				<p>
					Imagine you have a project, and you want people to collaborate and post their ideas, comment on them, etc.
					Now, it would be great to be able to see quickly the "hottest" ideas, the ideas that many people agree with, etc.
					This is what this visualization tries to achieve.
				</p>
			
			<h2>Input</h2>
				<p> Our data is a set of ideas. Every idea has many attributes:
					<ul><li>A title
					</li><li>A description
					</li><li>A user (the one who posted the idea)
					</li><li>Many comments
					</li><li>Votes up, down
					</li><li>etc.
					</li></ul>
				<p>
				<p> Here, the following attributes have been selected
					<ul><li>The title of idea
					</li><li>Number of comments
					</li><li>Number of Votes Up
					</li><li>Number of Votes Down
					</li></ul>
				</p>
				
			<h2>How to visualise it ?</h2>
				<p>
					Ideas will be sorted by their "hotteness", and the first one will be displayed in the center of the screen as a big "bubble". 
					Then, the first other ones (by hotteness) will be on a circle around the first idea (for example, a circle that can contain 9 bubbles).
					Then, the ideas that come after that will be displayed on circles further from the center, that can contain more ideas
				</p>
				<p> 
					The bubbles can have different properties to represent the n parameters :
					<br />The size : could represent the global hotteness (a ||.|| of all the values: number of comments, votes up and down)
					<br />The color : could represent the overall approbation of the idea (number Votes Up/number Votes Down)
					<br />A tooltip to show more information
				</p>
			
			<h2>Perspectives</h2>
				<ul><li>The bubbles could link to the page of the idea
				<ul><li>Or, when clicked, they would display a graph showing who agreed/disagreed more precisely :
				<br />	(For example, designers liked the idea, but the engineers thought it would be too hard/expensive, etc.)
				</li><li>Votes from VIP could be given more weight
				</li></ul>
